# Projects

(insert project relations map)

Before starting a new project checklist

- [ ] define the gain (skill, eternal glory, monetary etc.)
- [ ] define the scope, one week, two week? long term?
- [ ] What's the budget? Do we have time to finish within the scope?
- [ ] Minimum viable product all the way to sunday - completing on time is gold. features are coppers.
- [ ] define the audience, will someone actually USE the project?
- [ ] is it possible to make a youtube demo of the project?


Some pointers for the unwary
* Projects that relate or use an existing project tie up the bag nicely.
* Monetary gains must be considered. I'd love to give everything for free, but it's not maintainable.
* If you know that you are going to use it yourself there is at least one user, the most loyal user you can have.
* Projects that improve the overall 'project throughput' are golden. (chili-core, sta-mina etc.)


## Project pipeline :goat:
The status of each task and project is visible under the 'pipeline' project in this repository.

(insert a timeline of projects from 2016-2020)

in progress
- cartlet: coinbase commerce integrations to checkout with cryoto, ether/ltc/bitcoin.
- textchannel-cryptolizard: sms brokering service and gateway that builds on crypto-hexchange.
    - maybe we can replace the hexchange integration with a EVM contract.
- chili-ext-game prototype: html5 game based on chili-core, long term currently in progress.
    - in-progress currently working on concept art.

planned
- timeless-gitmon: time reporting for developers, one day timeboxed activity.
    - tried out some IntelliJ plugins for time tracking, they were not great.
- ~~crypto-hexchange: order brokering with web ui. intensive project, to be dated..~~
    - probably scrap this one, there are too many exchanges out there already.
- ~~ether-gate: ethereum payment processing, demo with flashcards-webapp..~~
    - this is probably no longer relevant since coinbase commerce launched. integrate with that instead.
    


maintenance
- ethereum-ingest: event ingestion to a queryable data store, for analysis and real time infographics/dashboard etc.
- kibana-mithril: authentication plugin for Kibana with LDAP, MongoDB and two-factor support.
- excelastic: excel/csv import utility for ElasticSearch, used to visualize expenses.
- zapperfly-asm: clustered build system for java, focuses on ease of setup.
- flashcards-webapp: finish in near future, chili-core project and ethereum integration.
- cartlet: simple webshop with support for swish payments.
- chili-core: feature complete for the moment and no known bugs (wtf?).

Possible future projects
- flic-desktop: a side project, connecting flic to Delphi desktop apps.
- cluster-tunes: multi-room audio with Android/desktop support. Not likely as Airfoil finally provided an update!
- docker-proxy: a docker proxy that starts containers on demand and stops when inactive, downscaling/multi-tenancy.
    - there's a rise in micro-containers so probably scrap this one.

## Wishlist :baby_chick:
- more non-java development (vyper, python, delphi, LLL ?)
- projects that can be released and actually used by someone else.
- some pi-zero project
- more hacking, bug bounties? blockchain related?
- some low level project, ASM/VHDL. OR LLL ?!
