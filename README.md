# programmer-roadmap :star2:
A repo used to plan skills development and projects. A list of technologies to keep in the toolbox and some new :sparkles: to keep it fresh.

Issues in this repository are completable tasks and comes in the following flavors
- technology: adding new tech to the stack or upgrading existing.
- research: evaluate by investigation, searching/reading etc.
- reading: read a designated book or an article for pure skills development.
- project: a completable project with an end goal, must be demo-able.
- experimentation: trying out a new framework/idea to get a feel for it.
- algorithms: the implementation and design of algorithms, can be included in projects.
- achievement: passive long term goals, example: "release a project using X".
- youtube: things relating to my youtube channel.

The current issues and projects focus on a selected key areas in which to improve.

## Project pipeline :goat:
The status of each task and project is visible under the 'pipeline' project in this repository.

in progress
- chili-core: ongoing long term project, used in other projects as much as possible.
- chili-ext-game prototype: html5 game based on chili-core, long term currently in progress.

planned
- timeless-gitmon: time reporting for developers, one day timeboxed activity.
- crypto-hexchange: order brokering with web ui. intensive project, to be dated.
- ether-gate: ethereum payment processing, demo with flashcards-webapp.

maintenance
- ethereum-ingest: event ingestion to a queryable data store, for analysis and real time infographics/dashboard etc.
- kbn-authentication-plugin: development driven by community demand. low priority.
- excelastic: development driven by community demand. low priority.
- zapperfly-asm: clustered build system for java, focuses on ease of setup.
- flashcards-webapp: finish in near future, chili-core project and ethereum integration.

Possible future projects

- textchannel-cryptolizard: sms brokering service and gateway that builds on crypto-hexchange.
- flic-desktop: a side project, connecting flic to Delphi desktop apps.
- cluster-tunes: multi-room audio with Android/desktop support. Not likely as Airfoil finally provided an update!
- docker-proxy: a docker proxy that starts containers on demand and stops when inactive, downscaling/multi-tenancy.

All projects needs to provide a value of some sort, skills development, monetary gains, reputation etc.
All projects must include a well written readme and a youtube demo.

## Wishlist :baby_chick:
- more non-java development (vyper, python, delphi, LLL ?)
- projects that can be released and actually used by someone else.
- some pi-zero project
- more hacking, bug bounties? blockchain related?
- some low level project, ASM/VHDL. OR LLL ?!

## Why should YOU care? :bird:
This repository shows the benefits of planning your own skills development and ongoing/future projects. Using the same techniques you could achieve the following:

- never forget about exciting technology that you have read about, add it to your todo list.
- make sure you are always improving and moving forward by adding and completing new tasks.
- plan the completion and start of new projects.
- prioritize projects and skills development, focus on whats important.
- by keeping a backlog of projects and skills development tasks you are less likely to run out of ideas.
