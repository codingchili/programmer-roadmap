### About issues

Issues in this repository are completable tasks and comes in the following flavors
- technology: adding new tech to the stack or upgrading existing.
- research: evaluate by investigation, searching/reading etc.
- reading: read a designated book or an article for pure skills development.
- project: a completable project with an end goal, must be demo-able.
- experimentation: trying out a new framework/idea to get a feel for it.
- algorithms: the implementation and design of algorithms, can be included in projects.
- achievement: passive long term goals, example: "release a project using X".
- youtube: things relating to my youtube channel.

## Why should YOU care? :bird:
This repository shows the benefits of planning your own skills development and ongoing/future projects. Using the same techniques you could achieve the following:

- never forget about exciting technology that you have read about, add it to your todo list.
- make sure you are always improving and moving forward by adding and completing new tasks.
- plan the completion and start of new projects.
- prioritize projects and skills development, focus on whats important.
- by keeping a backlog of projects and skills development tasks you are less likely to run out of ideas.
