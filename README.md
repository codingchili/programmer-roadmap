## Project pipeline
- chili-core: ongoing long term project, used in other projects as much as possible.
- flashcards-webapp: finish in near future, chili-core project and ethereum integration.
- timeless-gitmon: time reporting for developers, one day timeboxed activity.
- crypto-hexchange: order brokering with web ui. intensive project, to be dated.
- excelastic: development driven by community demand. low priority.
- kbn-authentication-plugin: development driven by community demand. low priority.
- chili-core prototype: html5 game based on chili-core, long term currently in progress.
- ethereum-ingest: event ingestion to a queryable data store, for analysis and real time infographics/dashboard etc.
- ether-gate: ethereum payment processing, demo with flashcards-webapp.

All projects needs to provide a value of some sort, skills development, monetary gains, reputation etc.
All projects must include a well written readme and a youtube demo.

Wishlist
- more non-java development
- projects that can be released and actually used by someone else.
- some pi-zero project
- more hacking, bug bounties? blockchain related?
